description: What is Moodle Tool Guide?
---

_Moodle Tools Guide_ is a reference card for using [Moodle][moodle] version 3 and later, designed for teachers, educators and trainers. It provides info about the main Moodle tools and what tool to use according to the pedagogical goal to achieve. It also mentions the [Bloom taxonomic levels][bloom] that can be reached when using the different tools.

An idea of [Joyce Seitzinger](https://www.joyceseitzinger.com/) of [Eastern Institute of Technology](https://www.eit.ac.nz/) (NZ). Adapted in May 2020 for Moodle 3.x by [Nicolas Martignoni][nm], based on work on version 2 by [Gavin Henrick](https://www.brickfield.ie/about_us/).
